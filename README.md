# What is this?
This repository is full of everything I make at DigiPen.
# Why does it look like this?
I am using this like Google Drive or OneDrive because it helps to keep things organized, and it is easiest to use because I can't get G-drive there and I can get the Atom text editor.
# Commits
My Commit summaries are basically what I did that day, because I usually commit at the end of each day and once if I edit it at home.
