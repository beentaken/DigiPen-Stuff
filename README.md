# What is this?
This repository is full of everything I make at DigiPen.
# Compiling
I use Cygwin when compiling c files. https://www.cygwin.com/

I use ZeroEngine when runing and compiling .zeroproj games. I can't find where to download it right now, because it is being shut down. I think we are moving to Unity too.
# Commits
My commits are basically summaries of what I did that day, because I usually commit at the end of each day and once if I edit it at home.
