# What is this?
This repository is full of everything I make at DigiPen.
# Why does it look like this?
I am using this like Google Drive or OneDrive because it helps to keep things organized and it helps me learn how to use Git.
# Commits
My commits are basically summaries of what I did that day, because I usually commit at the end of each day and once if I edit it at home.
