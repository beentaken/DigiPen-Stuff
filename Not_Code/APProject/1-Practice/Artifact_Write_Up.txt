|  My innovation is <innovation name>, which is designed to make it easy for consumers
| to <benificial for consumers>. The <innovation name> functions as a <parts needed to make it work>. When <thing that user does>,
| <what innovation does>. Then, <what the server does>. Then, <what the innovation does with the server's data.
| My artifact provides an illustration for each step of the process of the steps that 
| smart speakers go through to answer the user's question.

|  I used Microsoft Paint to create my artifact. I gathered relevant images with an online
| search. I then made captions to explain my images, and made a flowchart with the
| steps of how smart speakers work. I included extra images to show how the data is
| processed. This is a new artifact, as I gathered images and wrote the explanations myself.

|  A beneficial effect is that smart speakers make information more accessable to people.
| Smart speakers reduce the amount of effort that it takes to find relavent information. 
| for example, If I am trying to make cookies for an ugly sweater party, I could ask my smart 
| speaker for a christmas cookie recipe, and the speaker would step me through how to make
| the cookies, rather than me having to worry about using my phone while my hands are dirty.
| 
|  A harmful effect is that smart speaker creators have access to the voice data
| of the users. Even though they say what thay do with the data, you can never be sure what
| actually happens with it. Smart speakers have allowed for information to become more 
| convinent to people, as a reported 20% of Americans have a smart speaker in their house.
| Soon, everyone may have a smart speaker. This would grant smart speaker creators 
| access to all the data they want. With the growing issue of online privacy, this is an 
| issue for anybody who uses a virtual assistant.

|  Smart speakers operate by constantly recording with it's microphones and constantly scanning the
| recording for a wake command. When the speaker detects the wake command, it listens for the 
| user's command. When the uset is done giving their command, the speaker uses a neural network to 
| figure out what the user said and change it into text. Then, the user's command is sent off to a 
| server where the proper response to the user's command is determined. Once the Server has 
| determined what the proper response is, the response is sent back to the device to be "read" by 
| the speaker.
| 
|  A privacy concern is that smart speaker creators have access to user data, and nobody except
| them truly know how they use the data.
