| My artifact shows the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pinson the Raspberry Pi being used to 
| controll two motors of a robot car.

| My innovation is the Raspberry Pi, which is a small project computer that has special pins that 
| you can use to control things like motors. The Raspberry Pi functions like a normal computer,
| except it has a small form factor and a small price tag. The Raspberry Pi costs a meer $35.
| This makes it an easy choice for robot building and home automation, because it is both small and 
| easy to replace. If sombody wanted to make something using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, they 
| simply have to write a program in python using the GPIO Zero library.
| My artifact provides an illustration of how the Raspberry Pi can be hooked up to various 
| electronics to control them.

| I used Pinta for Linux to make my artifact. I gathered relevant images with an online search. I
| then made laied out a simple wireing diagram for a small electric car with two motors. This is a 
| new artifact, as I gathered images and wrote the explanations myself.
